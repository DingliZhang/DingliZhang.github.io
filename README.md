## [Optimize OpenCV for RISC-V](https://plctlab.github.io/opencv/Optimize_OpenCV_for_RISC-V.html)

Yin Zhang, 2020.11.16

This is a Google Summer of Code project participated by Yin, a graduate student of PLCT lab. We adds a back-end implementation based on RISC-V vector extension for OpenCV in this project. This blog introduced the project and how to build and use it.

## [Building instruction and test of BishengJDK11 on HiFive Unleashed](https://plctlab.github.io/openjdk/Building_instruction_and_test_of_BishengJDK11_on_HiFive_Unleashed.html)

Dingli Zhang, 2020.11.20

BishengJDK 11 now brings the template interpreter and backends of C1/C2 compiler to the RISC-V world. We supports RV64G (G used to be represent the IMAFD base and extensions of RISC-V ISA) with BV (bit-manipulation and vector extensions) on the way, and the compressed instructions are out of plan.

This test is to build the JDK on RISCV64 and start to do some benchmark on HiFive Unleashed.
